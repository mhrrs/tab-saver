12/26/2022: all tabs can be pulled from the window and then presented to the screen in the content.html file.
next steps include:
- allow for naming of current window.
- store details of window in firebase db
- create html page that allows for users to either save current window or open old archived window

IDEA on Product:
- This product is not just to save a window of tabs. It's to optimize work. If you can categorize the pages you're on then you can immediately open a particular window. This idea could be about making a better window, something that hasn't been made in a while.

IDEA on Business:
- Maybe we can do business the same way that Honey did. We can provide gift codes etc whenever someone decides to reopen their window and shop.
- It's both a tab saver and discount tool
